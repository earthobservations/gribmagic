MERRA-2
*******
The Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) is
a global atmospheric reanalysis produced by the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office
(GMAO). It spans the satellite observing era from 1980 to the present. The goals of MERRA-2
are to provide a regularly-gridded, homogeneous record of the global atmosphere, and to
incorporate additional aspects of the climate system including trace gas constituents
(stratospheric ozone), and improved land surface representation, and cryospheric processes.

******************
COSMO-CLM + MERRA2
******************
Atmospheric hindcast for Western Europe and the North Atlantic using
COSMO-CLM version 5.0 with spectral nudging from 2002-2017.
MERRA2 reanalysis data are used as forcing.

CMIP / CMIP6
************
The objective of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) is to better
understand past, present and future climate changes arising from natural,
unforced variability or in response to changes in radiative forcing in a
multi-model context.
